KivEnt
======

KivEnt is an Entity Based Game Engine for Kivy

Requires Cymunk in order to run: 
get the master branch from here:https://github.com/tito/cymunk

You will need to compile both the cymunk module as well as the kivent_cython folders code.

I develop using [Kivy 1.8](https://github.com/kivy/kivy) (so current indevelopment branch, this is because there are some great performance enhancements
in the most recent branch)

Tested on Asus Transformer TF101, Droid 4, Droid RAZR M, Ubuntu 13.04
