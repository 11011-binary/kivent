KivEnt
======

KivEnt is an Entity Based Game Engine for Kivy

Requires Cymunk in order to run: 
get the master branch from here:https://github.com/tito/cymunk

You will also need KivEnt-QuadTree from here:
get the master branch from here: https://github.com/Kovak/KivEnt-QuadTree

You will need to compile both modules

I have added a cythonized version of the engine in the kivent_cython folder. Testing on Asus Transformer TF101 the cythonized library's update loop takes half the time of the regular.
