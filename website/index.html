<p>KivEnt is a framework for building performant, dynamic real-time scenes in Kivy. At the moment it is 2d oriented. The only dependency for the kivent_core module is <a href="http://kivy.org">Kivy</a> itself. Additional modules may have other requirements, such as kivent_cymunk module being based on <a href="https://chipmunk-physics.net/">Chipmunk2d</a> and its <a href="https://github.com/tito/cymunk">cymunk</a> wrapper.</p>

<p>An entity-component architecture is used to control game object state and the logic of processing the game objects. This means that your game objects will be made up of collections of independent components that stricly hold data; each component corresponds to a GameSystem that will perform all data processing on the components, in the update loop each frame, and as a result of user interaction or other programmaticaly generated events. All memory for 
the built-in components is allocated statically: if you would like learn more
about memory management, <a href="http://kivent.org/docs/memory_handlers.html">read here</a> </p>

<p>KivEnt is built with a modular architecture and designed to have both a python api and a c-level cython api that allows more performant access to your game data. This makes it suitable for quickly prototyping a mechanic completely in python, and relatively trivial to then deeply cythonize that GameSystem if you find it to be performance sensitive. This process has already been done for the built-in components meaning they are ready for you to build new, performant game systems on top of them.</p>

<p> The entire framework is made available to you with an MIT license so that you have the freedom to build whatever you want on top of it and monetize it however you like. </p>

<p>A little over a year ago KivEnt 1.0 was released and here are some examples 
  of things created using the framework</p>
<ul>
    <li>The Boardz Alpha was released for android a few months ago: <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.chozabu.boardzfree&hl=en">free</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.chozabu.boardz&hl=en">ad-free</a>.</li>
    <li>chozabu has also worked on a graphical editor for building levels 
      <a href="https://github.com/chozabu/KivEntEd">github</a></li>
</ul>
<p>KivEnt 2.0 represents 344 commits by 6 contributors! A huge thank you to 
  github users chozabu, tshirtman, mahomahomaho, squarrel, and inclement!</p>
<p>
  Compared to the KivEnt 1.0 release there has been 17,663 additions, 4,267 
  deletions, we now have Windows support, performance has increased significantly,
  the python api has been cut down and simplified, and the cython api has advanced 
  significantly. It should be fairly easy to create new GameSystems benefiting
  from the static memory optimizations, and much easier to write new renderers 
  that make use of different shader formats.</p>
<p>
  The plan for the next few months is to finish up porting the cymunk
  module, rewriting the particles module, and writing a significant amount 
  of tutorials to cover all the new additions. </p>
